## Roadmap Philosophy

> **"Ship fast, learn faster."**
> Build the minimum viable version that delivers real value, measure everything, and iterate based on data — not assumptions.

### Guiding Principles
1. **User Outcome First** — Every feature must improve employability
2. **AI-Native** — AI is core, not a bolt-on
3. **Data Moat** — Every interaction builds our advantage
4. **Community Network** — Users create value for each other
5. **International from Day 1** — English-first, India/Europe priority
